# The Sea Wolf
_An online shop made using Laravel_

Back in March 2023, when I was just learning the ropes as a self-taught programmer, I made my first ever website. It was an online shop selling surfboards and diving equipment. As I was only 4 months into learning programming at the time, it was a very simple website, made with Django and Bootstrap. It was named _The Sea Wolf_, after a Jack London novel.

9 months later, in December 2023, I've grown a lot as a developer and have decided to remake that website using a different tech stack. On the back-end, Laravel will replace Django since I work with PHP now as a professional web dev. And on the front end, Bootstrap will be abandoned in favour of vanilla CSS and JavaScript.
